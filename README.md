# PythonLearning
Random programs and scripts to learn and practice Python!

WoW (words of wisdom) -wow_prog.py- is a program that takes three text file containing quotes (I chose them randomly from internet), depending on your answer to how are you feeling, it will give you a random quote from 'Down', 'Normal, or 'Motivated' categories:)

gau_fit is just a simple program for gaussian fit on one example of nmr data that I measured during my PhD in University of Parma. There, I fitted this data with fminuit and Matlab scripts, now I was just trying to reproduce it with python:)
